# Barefoot
Boilerplate for a React Redux SPA.  
Complete with configurations and tools for a more agile development.  
Create from scratch (no CRA here) and in constant improvement as my knowledge grows

## Getting Started

### Installation

Let's start by forking this repo.  
To do that you just need to click the **Fork** button at the top of the page.  

After creating a "fork" of the project you can then access **Settings** and change the project name.  
You can also continue with the same name if you wish to open PRs to me.

Now you can clone your fork to your development machine.  
Click on the **Clone or download** button in your project's page, copy the link and clone.  
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-user-name]/[your-project].git
```

### Usage

Since this is a boilerplate and not a generator (yet) we need to cleanup some code.  

##### README
Feel free to modify all the **README** file but keep the original **LICENCE**.  
Giving credit back in your own **README** would be much appreciated.  

##### package.json
